**- Step 3:** Once the zip package is downloaded we need to locate it.  This is usually the Downloads folder.  Once you have located the package we need to extract it. It is suggested that you move this package to your desired location such as your desktop before extraction.  Once you have moved the file to your desired location you can right click on the package and select `Extract All`
